The anterior plate fits against the concave side of the posterior plate and bears a ridge shaped apodeme (apodemal carina) that is attached to large dilator muscles that attach to clypeus. Their contraction pulls the anterior plate forward, enlarging the cibarial lumen and thus producing suction.

comment: DOS:  This term and definition look dodgy to me for a variety of reasons.  Seems odd to have  vagueness vs crispness of spatial boundaries as a differentium. A "3D region in space" does not have mass - even though this classified as an anatomical structure, which does.  'Compartmental boudary' has a specific meaning to developmental biologists that is presumably not intended here.
