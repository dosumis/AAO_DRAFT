def: "A region of the integument that is hardened, typically with thick exocuticle, and which is bounded by relatively less hardened regions of the integument." []
comment: Earlier versions of this def specified bounded by conjunctivae, but in discussion at the Asilomar meeting we decided to keep this broad - a long, narrow region with relatively low levels of hardening may count as a depression or groove but not as a conjunctiva.
